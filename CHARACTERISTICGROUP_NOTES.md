# Concept: The Digital Folder 

- Think of the CharacteristicGroup (Python Class) as a digital folder or a data record card for one specific content dimension.

- Your Content Beacon has 9 primary dimensions (like "Person Characteristics," "Audio Characteristics," etc.). Every one of those dimensions is stored as an instance of this ``` python CharacteristicGroup ``` class.

- Its job is to keep all the related data and metadata (like the time it was created) cleanly bundled together.
